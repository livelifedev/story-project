        It has been a long journey now for Crow. He has seen the lands, crossed
        the seas, experienced many things, met wonderful people, met horrible
        people and seen the destruction of the world.
      </p>

      <p>This was not how he imagined the end of his journey to be.</p>

      <p>

        missing. Something he was seeking, but couldnâ€™t find.
