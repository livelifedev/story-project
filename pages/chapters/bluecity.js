      <p>
        From the outside, there was something just captivating about this city.
        A powerful, blue glow that drew people in, bridges like metal vines
        constricting the colossal skyscrapers that touched the clouds, and
        vehicles flying around those things like tiny birds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Indeed, it was very captivating and Crow couldnâ€™t wait to step foot
        inside.
