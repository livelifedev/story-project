        One day, on the job cleaning a deep chimney, the boy stumbled upon a
        secret tunnel. He followed it and on the other end was an enormous
        chamber, what he saw there troubled his mind.

        Chained down to ground was a crow, the size of the chamber itself. The
        boy watched it and saw a painful reflection.
