        One day, on the job cleaning a deep chimney, the boy stumbled upon a
        tunnel to a hidden chamber - what he saw in there really troubled him.
      </p>

      <p>Chained down to ground in the darkness was a gargantuan crow.</p>

      <p>
        The boy watched it and saw a painful reflection... Gazing up towards the
        sky, wanting to get out but trapped.
      </p>

      <p>It was here, the boy decided it was timeâ€¦ he released the shackles.</p>
