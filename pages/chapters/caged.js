        One day, on the job cleaning a deep chimney, the boy stumbled upon a
        secret tunnel. He followed it and on the other end was an enormous
        chamber, what he saw there troubled him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chained down to ground was a gargantuan crow, the size of the chamber
        itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The boy watched it and he saw a painful reflection... Gazing up towards
        the sky, wanting to get out but trapped.
      </p>

      <p>It was here, the boy decided it was timeâ€¦ he released the shackles.</p>
