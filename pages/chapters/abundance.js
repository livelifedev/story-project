      <p>This city is so bizarre, Crow thought.</p>

      <p>
        Not sure whether to laugh in amusement or frown with judgement at what
        he saw.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suits, robots and greaseâ€¦ the combination really did not paint a pretty
        picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        While so many things to see and do, the city was definitely draining.
        Crowds racing in all directions, people hooked into their machines, the
        difficulty to catch anyones attention.
      </p>

      <p>It was all too much for Crow, it all felt very abundant.</p>
