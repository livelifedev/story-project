      <p>
        I recently dug this up, a picture book I did for my final design project
        in high school- 10 years ago. It's weird reading back through it after
        all this time, the writing's definitely cringey and the illustrations
        aren’t the best, nevertheless I still like the project. Since I’ve
        started drawing again after so long, I figured it would be a cool side
        project to paint over every single illustration from this book… Have a
        look through if you please. (Note: I've pixelated the images that aren’t
        done yet, which at this point is most of them!! Also, I quickly hacked
        this website together, so not the prettiest thing.)
